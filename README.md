## My process

- Create styles.css file & add style guidelines as notes
- Set up colors and paragraph font as variables (font converted to rem)
- Add `<link>` elements for google fonts to index.html `<head>`
- Set up github repository
- Draft HTML
- Draft CSS
  - Had a couple of iterations of working on the CSS to try to make it clean and use BEM

### Built with

Vanilla HTML and CSS
Mobile first approach
Attempted to make it responsive and easy to adjust with variables
Block element method CSS naming

### What I learned

I was able to use width: min() to avoid the need for @media for mobile screens
It was the first time I properly used tables, so read up a but about table formats
Had to mess around a bit with the list items. Learned the various ways to format markers.

### Continued development

There's one weird issue I noticed with this that I couldn't resolve. The format of the fony of the ordered list bullet does not look like Outfit, but it shows up correctly as outfit in the inspector. I tried various ways to make sure the font was being properly applied to the marker, but can't figure out whey it's wrong.
